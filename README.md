# TimeValidator

### Purpose
The main purpose of the time validator repository is to validate if the time slot chosen by client is within the correct range. In other words, it should be between opening and closing hours. We also check if the time chosen by user is not in the lunch or fika break. So when the time is valid the data will be send to the next component to be filter.
